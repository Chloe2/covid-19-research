# COVID-19 Research
This repository contains a Colab notebook that is hooked up with the most recent data and can be run again as new data comes in.

We present interactive plots and use probabilistic inference to make country-level predictions for the number of daily deaths due to COVID-19.

Please consider our [blog post](www.intelecy.com) for further details.
